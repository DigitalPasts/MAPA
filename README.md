## Mesopotamian Ancient Place-names Almanac

The “Mesopotamian Ancient Place-names Almanac” (MAPA) focuses on the southern Mesopotamian city of Uruk ([modern Warka](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/912986)). It is one of the earliest mega-cities in world history, with evidence of settlement as far back as the 4th Millennium BCE. Uruk possesses some of the earliest attestations of the cuneiform writing system, and boasts of being the royal seat of the legendary king Gilgamesh. MAPA is a first step in integrating textual sources with remote sensing data for reconstructing the social and physical geography of Mesopotamia in the Age of Empires (first millennium BCE). The core of the project is a gazetteer of place names in texts and surveys, both on the ground and via satellite.

The dataset, presented here in CSV and JSON formats, is the presentation of a gazetteer drawn from legal, economic and administrative texts from the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid periods, issued in and around the Mesopotamian city of Uruk. The listed toponyms were input manually from the books and articles in the *bibliography*. The gazetteer follows the JSON-LD based [Linked Places format](https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places/blob/master/tsv_0.3.md) of the [World Historical Gazetteer](http://whgazetteer.org/). This readme contains a key to the database’s fields, a few issues to be resolved in future iterations, the next steps of the MAPA project and a bibliography.

### Field Title Key

`site_ID` A unique 4-digit durable numerical identifier, assigned to each unique place.

`label` A four letter identifier, drawn from the document’s title. The letters are drawn from the spelling of the *title*. The first letter indicates the type of feature in question: *S* indicates a settlement, *W* indicates a hydrological feature, *C* indicates a piece of urban infrastructure, *G* indicates an agricultural floodplain, and *B* indicates a *Bāb* (gate, or lock connected to a canal or river) or *Bīt* (estate, alternatively the settlement area of a tribal group).

`title` The accepted normalised form of the ancient placename in contemporary academic literature, i.e. the spelling used in reference materials. This is taken as the “name” of the feature.

`variant_Akkadian` The syllabic Akkadian spelling of the toponym’s name, as written in Babylonian texts. This accommodates further searches in the ancient sources. There are often numerous spellings, which are listed here set off by semi-colons.

`type` The type of feature under discussion. These are listed according to the ontology of the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus or AAT (getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat).

`sub_type` A more specific description of the feature, as much as is possible. These are listed according to the hierarchies elucidated in AAT. Like “type,” this section will expand and evolve as understanding of the region increases through the project.

`title_source` The primary modern citation for the information in the document. These are listed by citation key, referencing the BibTex and RIS files in this release.

`t-s_pages` For ease of querying, the pages of the entry in the above source.

`Uruk_relation` A text field, with notes of the feature’s location in relation to Uruk, as recorded in the title_source text.

`Uruk_probability` The probability of the location notes specifically, and the information in the document generally, being correct. This is according to the information in the title_source text.

`place_terms` This column records, for ease of use, the names of generic geographic features included within the names of individual places. This includes *Kār* (Quay), *Tīl* (Tell), among others.

`determinatives` This field records the determinatives from the ancient Babylonian spelling of the placename, i.e. *d* (Dingir) preceding divine names.

`language` Records the linguistic background of the placename, using ISO 3-letter language codes. See links to SIL.org.

`language_prop` Records any uncertainty regarding the data in *langauge*.

`proper_nouns` Names of people, gods, and professions, primarily, contained within the name of the place in question.

`p-n_type` Type of noun recorded in *proper_nouns*: Divine names, personal names, professional names, or general appellatives.

`p-n_type_prop` Records any uncertainty regarding the data in *p-n_type*.

`variant_modern` The modern (usually Arabic) name given to the feature, if it is known. It is recorded here both romanised and in the original Arabic.

`notes` A text field which contains information deemed important to the gazetteer, but which did not neatly fit into the existing categories. This can include variant spellings of the *title* among the various *title_sources*, literature references, multiple iterations of an identical spelling, among others. Context of the *LOC_details* is also recorded here.

`LOC_details` Records the way in which the title place connects to the places recorded in the LOC fields. Each field is treated in turn, set off by semicolons. These are intended to be direct and succinct; additional context, such as directionality, is recorded in *Notes*.

`LOC-x` These fields, up to 5 at this point, are other toponyms in the gazetteer which are connected by a text or texts to the feature in question. They are recorded here by `site_ID`. Uncertainty is recorded in *LOC-1_probability*, while other probabilities are recorded in *Notes*.

`ccode` The ISO two-letter country code of the location.

`CDLI` Where relevant, the CDLI [Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative](https://cdli.ucla.edu/) provenance number.

`Pleiades` Where relevant, the Pleiades reference number (<https://pleiades.stoa.org/>).

### Project Next Steps

We are continuing to enrich the gazetteer. Additional instances for each entry are being added, according to the most up-to-date textual editions, as well as unpublished references, and linking them to the gazetteer. We are also curating site biographies for each of the ancient canals around Uruk. The biography describes each settlement in both physical and social terms: what kinds of social groups are active there, what are their main economic activities, and what natural features, agricultural systems, and technologies are attested there. Most interesting are the outgoing and incoming elements in each site (documented e.g. in administrative texts or correspondence). As these biographies are assembled, new information or connections that come to light will likewise be added to subsequent iterations of the gazetteer.
